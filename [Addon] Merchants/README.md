![](./banner.jpg)

Old World population tier with new needs, productions, workforce and a new public transportation system.

## Population

### Merchants

- Merchants are the new population tier after Artisans, when upgrading from artisans you will now get Merchants instead of engineers.
- Merchants rely on goods from other regions to advance, their needs usually require goods to be produced on 2 or more regions at a time, creating a logistical challenge and some new good opportunities.
- The needs of all populations were changed a bit, farmers get new need and luxury, workers get a new need and luxury, artisans get a new luxury, engineers have all need that were from artisans changed to needs from merchants. The necessary hapiness and suply bonuses were adjusted.
